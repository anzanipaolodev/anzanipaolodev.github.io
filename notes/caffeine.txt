Whats the problem with caffeine?
---
1. Addiciton
    - Cant not do daily work without

2. Tolerance
    - You need more and more to get the same effects
    - Month 1: 150mg/day --> Month 2: 200mg/day to achieve the same effect

3. Everything over 400mg/day (for adults male avrg) is NOT HEALTY ZONE
    - 1 Monster Ultra = 150mg -->  ~2.5 Monster Ultra/day 
    - 1 Monster ~= 3 Espresso --> 3 * 2.5 Espresso/day
