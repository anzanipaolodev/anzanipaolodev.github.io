How long does will it take to master coding
---
My goal: 10k hours of real coding

I assume I have already at least ~200 of qualty coding hours (probably more but better stay low)

Avarage h/day coding November/Decemeber 2023:
    - ~5 h/day

Hours left: 10000 - 2000
    - h/year = 1825 -> goal reached in ~5.3 years

Increase to 7 h/day
    - h/year = 2555 -> goal reached in ~3.8 years
