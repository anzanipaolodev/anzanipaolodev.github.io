People passionate about consumer electronics:
    - Smartphones
    - Laptop
    - Iot devices
    - "Smart" devices

They usually do not have a strong knowledge about computers
Yet they think they have

- Very rarely know how software layer work
    - When they talk about software they talk about:
        - UI/UX -> GOOD
        - Performance -> GOOD

- Almost never know how hardware layer work (they think they know this well -> BIG PROBLEM)
    - When talk about hardware they talk about:
        - Specs -> BAD
        - Benchmarks -> BAD
        - Hardware bench marks comparison -> VERY BAD

Whats the problem about hardware opinions
---
1. They do not have knowledge to properly understand specs
2. Not knowing software = Not knowing drivers = Not understand hardware performace

Usually make wrong assumptions:
    - higher clock speed = faster performance
    - synthetic benchmarks are a vaild way to evaluate and compare hardware performance
    - more ram/ more ram speed = always better performance
    - software does not have much influence on hardware performance

They think that software matters just on application benchmarks -> TOTALLY WRONG

How to better evaluate hardware
---
1. Application benchmark over Synthetic benchmarks
2. Value your use case (eg. Look for benchmarks of applications you will use)
3. Understand that software matters
4. Understand that more ram != more power, more speed
    - For most people 8GB of ram is more than enough on most of hardware

Reccomendations

Top choice for: 
    1. General use laptop (no specific software requirements):
        - Macbook air M1
    2. Software engineering (if you need to run or develop on VMs check for support):
        - Macbook air M1 (Slope shape is better than pro square shape)
        - Windows specific -> Dell xps
    3. Video editing / Content creation:
        - Macbook pro 14 (more storage is better here)

Why apple laptops are good:
    - Good performance
    - They last many years (5-10 years life span)

    If you are a developer you use your computer everyday:
        - Macbook air m1 at 1.229 Euro
        - Use it for 5 years 
        - It costs you ~= 0.7 Euro/day
        - It provides you with at least 0.7 Euro of value every day? Absolutely
            -> worth the money
