New form of ads
---
New model of social media ads is annoying

Old approach
    - Decdicated side space for ads clearly distinct from other content
    - Popups

New approach
    - Ads gets 'masked' as regular content
    - Appear in the same feed and form of actual content
    - Tagged with some words like ads, sponsored etc...
