Zero-sum game mentality
---
Viewing aspect of life as zero-sum games:
    -> My win is your loss and viceversa
    -> similar to 'Mors tua vita mea'

Thinking that the size of economic pie is fixed which implies that:
    - If the size is fixed to have a bigger slice you must take it from others
    - The pie can not grow it just can be redistributed

This is false -> economy actually grow

To increase your silce you can contribute to make the pie bigger
Economy in general is not a zero-sum game (but trading is)

You should focus on creating and providing value to other

Viewing all interaction bewtween people as zero-sum games is bad:
    - leads you to harmful decision
    - ignore morals
    - makes harder to trust others and make real deep connection
