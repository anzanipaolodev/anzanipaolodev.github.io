Overcome my lack of ability to focus
---
Never try an ADHD diagnosis -> Could potentially be affected by it

When i try to focus on something:
    - I feel i'm not get stimulated enough
    - I get lost on random thoughts
    - Usually stop what i'm doing start think and get lost in an endless flow

Day 1
---
I'm trying caffeine:
    - Monster Enery ultra -> 150mg caffeine

Report:
    - Started working on caffeine at ~15:50
    - Paused working on ~17:50 to eat (could go on more)
    - Peak focus in the first ~45min/1h then slowly decrease (still feeling the effect)
    - Resumed working at ~18:20
    - At ~18:40 cold hands effect started to go away
    - Kept working until 20:20, stopped for dinner (could kept going)

Negative effects:
    - Extremly cold hands (probably due to vasoconstriction)

Overall:
    - Positive experience
    - Felt really focused on working
    - Never lost in other thoughts
    - Cold hands is very annoying (almost painfull)
    - Worked 4 hours with almost no pause
    - General focus lasted till the end even tho work efficency was decreased in the last part

Hypothesis:
    1. Effect of caffeine was notable for 4 whole hours
    2. "Intertia" effect on focus even after caffeine effect disappeared
