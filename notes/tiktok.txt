Why TikTok is trash?
---
1. It makes you dumb (both on long and short term)
2. Its desgined to keep you scrolling
    - TikTok knows its core business its keeping you a zombie
    - In China TikTok its desgined yo just show educative content

 - THEORY:
 -> China owns TikTok 
 -> China knows it makes you dumb 
 -> China dont want chinese to be dumb

"ESCAPE THE MATRIX" phenomena
---
- The claim:
    - Education system is made to make you a labour slave

- The truths:
    - Education system trains you think in predifined schemes
        - This is not ALWAYS BAD but most of the time it is
    - School system is broken
        - School rewards you for remebering stuff -> remebering != learning
        - Pretend that you learn to much stuff
        - Should focus on less topics and actual learning
        - Its better to have deep knowledge of few stuff than broad knowledge on many

- The lies:
    - School is still usefull (necessary for 99% of people)
    - Even if not much, it makes you smarter
        - Prove: You can almost always tell if a person have quit school early in life

- The reality:
    - Who are "Escape matrix people"?
        - People who think school is useless ("it does not teach you how to make money!")
        - People who gets indoctrinated on TikTok by gurus and shit
        - People who based their ideology from shit on TikTok (which is the ACTUAL matrix)

The Matrix is real but -> Its all the social media platform

How to actually escape the matrix?
---
1. Use your phone as little as you can
    - If you can uninstall TikTok
    - If you dont want to: Opens it as little as possibile
    - Never use it more than 5 minutes straight
2. Turn off your phone whenever you can
3. Dont search for information on TikTok (NEVER)
4. Never think that what you see/read/hear is real
5. Understand that FOMO is bad for you
    
- Practical approach:
    1. Download an app bloker
    2. Set it for all social networks from 8:00AM to 8:00PM
    3. After 10:00PM stop using your phone (better if no screen at all)
