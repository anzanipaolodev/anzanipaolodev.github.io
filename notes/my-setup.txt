My setup
---
Computer:
    - Macbook pro 13(2020) (last intel model btw)
    - Intel i5 quad core 1.4GHz
        - Still very performant for me

Editor:
    - Vim
    - Vscode for bigger code bases (with vim extension)

I have used emacs for almost 2 years
    - Unecessary bloated
    - Becomes laggy pretty quickly

Desk:
    - HP 24 inches FULL HD
    - Apple magic mouse and magic keyboard (but mainly use the laptop keyboard)
