How to master something
---
- The 10'000 hours rule
    - You got to do something at least 10'000 hours to get good at it

- You want to master coding
    - Spend 5h/day coding -> It will take ~= 5.5 years to get 10000 hours
        - Spend 10/h day and it will take you half the time
        - 10'000 / (h/day * 365) = time_in_years

- Consistency is king
    - Nothing matter if you can be consistent
    - 90% of people will quit when their expecation are not realistics

- 'The man who loves walking will walk further than the man who loves the destination' -cit Unknown

- If you chase something for the sole purpose of money fame or status:
    - 99% of the times you will not get anywhere

- You must love the process in order not to quit on the first difficulties
    - Do not do something just beacuse you think it will make you rich
    - Always choose passion over money (if you do money will come anyway)

What do you want to do in your life?

    1. I want to pursuit a dream, career etc.
    2. I want to make money

People who give the second answet almost never make any money
-> Chasing money is NOT a way to make money
