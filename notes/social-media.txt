Why social media is bad and there is nothing we can do about it
---
Promote engagement over personal interests
    - It makes you belive that contents will be sorted by just your interested
    - True but only partially

Why?
---
The final goal is to keep you online as much as possible
    - You are not the client
    - The client are advertisers
    - You are literally, and by definition by them same platforms, the product
        - This is not an exaggeration, its just the harsh reality

You stay online many hours a day -> You generate value for the platform to sell to advertisers

How?
---
How can a platform can keep you online as much as possibile?
    - Feed you with contents which are more likely to make you interact with them
    - Feed as many contents as fast as possibile to keep you attention span always high 

Over years social platform discovered whats the most engaging feeling to "catch" users:
    - Anger

Content that triggers an anger reaction in you is the most engaging
    - You are more likely to interact with it
    - More interactions = you stay online more time = grows adv potential of the platform

This is just poison for your brain -> The more you consume the more you damage it

Platform like TikTok are built around this concepts

Comments sections are evil (by design)
---
Made to spread hate and toxicity (99% of the time)

Most of the time the top up comments are the most toxic ones

Avoid them as much as possibile
    - Do not even read the comments
    - If you do be aware that even reading them is toxic for your brain
    - They give you a deceptive image of reality
        - Leads you to either feel bad or (worse) join the hate

What should we do
---
Social media are slowly harming us
    - As individuals 
    - As a species

What could be done:
    1. Bring back small communities on the internet
    2. Reject toxicity-promoting social media platforms(TikTok)
        - If you still refuse to quit such platforms you should almost NEVER read comments

Why its so difficult to quit social media
---
Platforms levarages FOMO(Fear Of Missing Out):
    - Makes you feel disconnected from the world if you quit them
    - Makes you feel you are missing out important stuff
    - Makes you feel distant from your own friends
    - Gives you the idea that you can not build social interactions without them
    - You can not just leave anymore without them

This is the sad reality we ourself(humanity) constructed in less than 25 years

In just 5 years the situation will be even worse

In maybe 20 years there will be nothing we can do anymore

Old internet was better
---
Smaller groups of people similar to each others (forums, blogs, etc...)
    - More ideology isolation = Less hate

Less people on one platform = reduced risk of false mith and mis-information to spread in society

The mission
---
"I address all those who understand the gravity of the situation. Not everyone will want to fight this war, but that doesn't mean all is lost. It was us who gave the power to these platforms to enter our lives and make us slaves to them, and it's precisely for this reason that we also have the power to stop them. Let's stop ignoring the elephant in the room; the enemy has a name, and it's called TikTok. The time has come to stop it before it's too late. Anyone with the technical skills and, above all, the will to fight, step forward, because from today, ladies and gentlemen, we are at war."
